Documentation
-----

Depending on the current published LibRapid version and how many crates are in queue on docs.rs, you may need to build the docs yourself.
To do that, simply git-clone this repository and then run `cargo doc --open`. After that, your documentation should open automatically.

How does it work?
-----

The Rust-port of LibRapid is a derivative from the main library made for C++ and Python. It's goal is to be optimised for speedy calculations, mathematical and
scientific applications.
