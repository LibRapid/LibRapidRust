LibRapid for Rust - Fast. Reliable. Lightweight.
============

Credits
-----

The original idea comes from Pencilcaseman, I collaborated with him to get LibRapid into Rust. We're closely working together to provide
the best possible user experience and consistency over all libraries.

Why X? Why Y?

Sometimes I have to yank some versions. To stay updated, please consider joining our Discord! https://discord.gg/cGxTFTgCAC

You want to contribute? Sure! You can contribute with:

- ðŸš© Issues
- ðŸ™‡ Pull Requests (See `FORMATRULES.md` for more information)
- ðŸ’¡ Feature Suggestions (Via Discussions)

Be sure to add documentation to any new public API with examples, and running `cargo test` to ensure that your changes are valid.

Documentation
-----

Depending on the current published LibRapid version and how many crates are in queue on docs.rs, you may need to build the docs yourself.
To do that, simply git-clone this repository and then run `cargo doc`. After that, your documentation should be ready in `src/target/doc/index.html`.

How does it work?
-----

The Rust-port of LibRapid is a derivative from the main library made for C++ and Python. It's goal is to be optimised for speedy calculations, mathematical and
scientific applications.

Performance
-----

LibRapid for Rust is fully optimised - meaning your calculations for game scripts and maths will be faster as a result.
