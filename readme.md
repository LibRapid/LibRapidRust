LibRapid for Rust - Fast. Reliable. Lightweight.
============
Credits
-----
The original idea comes from Pencilcaseman, I collaborated with him to get LibRapid into Rust. We're closely working together to provide
the best possible user experience and consistency over all libraries.

How does it work?
----
The Rust-port of LibRapid is a derivative from the main library made for C++ and Python. It's goal is to be optimized for speedy calculations, mathematical and
scientific applications as well as matrice calculations (to come).

Performance
----
LibRapid for Rust is fully optimized - meaning your calculations for game scripts or maths will be faster. All functions that are implemented are either faster
than the Rust functions, as fast as them or bring new features to Rust, also optimized for speed.
