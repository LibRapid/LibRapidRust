LibRapid for Rust - Fast. Reliable. Lightweight.
============

Credits
-----

The original idea comes from Pencilcaseman, I collaborated with him to get LibRapid into Rust. We're closely working together to provide
the best possible user experience and consistency over all libraries.

Documentation
-----

Depending on the current published LibRapid version and how many crates are in queue on docs.rs, you may need to build the docs yourself.
To do that, simply git-clone this repository and then run `cargo doc`. After that, your documentation should be ready in src/target/doc/index.html.

How does it work?
-----

The Rust-port of LibRapid is a derivative from the main library made for C++ and Python. It's goal is to be optimized for speedy calculations, mathematical and
scientific applications.

Performance
-----

LibRapid for Rust is fully optimized - meaning your calculations for game scripts and maths will be faster as a result. All functions that are implemented bring new features to Rust, while being optimized for speed.
