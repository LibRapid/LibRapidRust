The original idea comes from Pencilcaseman, I collaborated with him to get LibRapid into Rust. We're closely working together to provide
the best possible user experience and consistency over all libraries.

Be sure to add documentation to any new public API with examples, and running `cargo test` to ensure that your changes are valid.

Documentation
-----

Depending on the current published LibRapid version and how many crates are in queue on docs.rs, you may need to build the docs yourself.
To do that, simply git-clone this repository and then run `cargo doc --open`. After that, your documentation should open automatically.

How does it work?
-----

The Rust-port of LibRapid is a derivative from the main library made for C++ and Python. It's goal is to be optimised for speedy calculations, mathematical and
scientific applications.
